2. `sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh`
3. `sudo apt update`
4. `sudo apt install build-essential git libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev nodejs node-gyp python-setuptools python-pip python-dev`
5. `pip install pycrypto`
6. `sudo reboot now`
7. `sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm request homebridge homebridge-httpmulti`

### Supervisor Setup
1. `sudo apt install supervisor`
